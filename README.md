# 👋 Hey, I'm Farid Khan

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a final-year Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham (with a Year in Industry), passionate about building **intelligent systems** that combine **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **performance-oriented design**.

## 🔬 Current Focus

- Emotion-aware communication systems (RoBERTa, PyTorch, NLP)
- Predictive maintenance using autoencoders, LSTMs, and causal inference
- Offline, privacy-focused ML tooling (Transformer-based text correction)
- Deployment of real-time deep learning models with Docker, ONNX, and Azure

### 🌏 Upcoming Research — Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Summer 2025)

- Participating in a cross-cultural emotion recognition project using EEG and eye-tracking data.
- Applying machine learning (PyTorch/TensorFlow) to classify emotional states across diverse populations.
- Focus on signal preprocessing, temporal modeling, and generalization of emotion recognition systems.
- Deliverable includes a full research report and presentation.

## 📌 Notable Projects


### 🧠 Emotion-Aware Messaging Interface (Signal Integration)
**Real-time emotion detection in Signal messaging**
- Developed a dual-model pipeline using RoBERTa for real-time emotion detection in messaging apps.
- Used sequential architecture: binary classification (Emotion/No Emotion) → multi-class (Anger, Fear, Sadness, Disgust, Happiness).
- Incorporated temporal context from the last 5 messages to improve emotion recognition.
- Integrated into Signal messenger with dynamic UI (color-coded message bubbles based on emotion).
- Achieved 91% accuracy (binary) and 88% (multi-class), with >80% user satisfaction in a usability study.

### 🌱 Palm Oil Detection via Satellite Imagery (ALTEN Ltd)
**Scalable model to detect and forecast palm oil deforestation**
- Used CNNs, Pix2Pix GANs, and K-Means on radar & satellite data
- 98% classification accuracy, forecasted deforestation trends via ARIMA
- Deployed on GCP, published article on Medium

### ✍️ Offline Grammar Correction Tool (ALTEN Ltd)
**Privacy-first grammar tool using fine-tuned T5-base**
- Local execution (no cloud), 5% better than Grammarly on in-house data
- Fine-tuned with ERRANT tagging + WildNLP augmentation
- Deployed in enterprise environment, full write-up on Medium

### 🚗 Car Boot Object Detection (ALTEN Ltd)

- Developed a YOLOv8-based model deployed on Android/iOS via ONNX to detect missing safety items in car boots.
- Achieved 98% accuracy and 20ms inference time in real-time conditions.
- Deployed using Azure DevOps in a CI/CD pipeline for continuous model improvement.
